### A：对F的赞美

Tens of thousands of 18-year-olds will graduate this year and be handed meaningless diplomas. These diplomas won't look any different from those awarded their luckier classmates. Their validity(有效性) will be questioned only when their employers discover that these graduates are **semiliterate**(半文盲的)**.**

今年将有好几万的十八岁青年毕业，他们都将被授予毫无意义的文凭。这些文凭看上去跟颁发给比他们幸运的同班同学的文凭没什么两样。只有当雇主发现这些毕业生是半文盲时， 文凭的效力才会被质疑。

Eventually a fortunate few will find their way into educational-repair shops — adult-literacy programs, such as the one where I teach basic grammar and writing. There, high-school graduates and high-school **dropouts** pursuing graduate-equivalency certificates will learn the skills they should have learned in school. They will also discover they have been cheated by our educational system.

最后，少数幸运者会进入教育维修车间——成人识字课程，我教的一门关于基础语法和写作的课程就属于这种性质。在教育维修车间里，高中毕业生和高中辍学生将学习他们本该在学校就学好的技能，以获得同等学力毕业证书。他们还将发现他们被我们的教育体系欺骗了

As I teach, I learn a lot about our schools. Early in each session I ask my students to write about an unpleasant experience they had in school. No writers' block here!! " I wish someone would have had made me stop doing drugs and made me study.”“I liked to party and no one seemed to care." "I was a good kid and didn't cause any trouble, so they just passed me along even though I didn't read well and couldn't write." And so on.

在我教课的过程中，我对我们的学校教育深有了解。在每学期开始的时候，我会让我的 学生写一下他们在学校的不快体验。这种时候学生不会有任何写作障碍! “我希望当时有人 能让我停止吸毒，让我学习。”“我喜欢参加派对，似乎没人在意。”“我是一个好孩子，不会 制造任何麻烦，于是他们就让我考试通过，即使我阅读不好，也不会写作。”很多诸如此类的抱怨。

I am your basic **do-gooder** ,and prior to teaching this class I blamed the poor academic skills our kids have today on drugs, divorce and other **impediments** to concentration necessary for doing well in school. But, as I rediscover each time I walk into the classroom, before a teacher can expect students to concentrate, he has to get their attention, no matter what distractions may be at hand. There are many ways to do this, and they have much to do with teaching style. However, if style alone won't do it, there is another way to show who holds the winning hand in the classroom. That is to reveal the trump card of failure

我基本是一个**空想社会改良家**，在教这门课之前，我将孩子们的学习能力差归咎于毒品、离婚和其它**妨碍**注意力集中的东西，要想学习好就必须集中注意力。但是，我每一次走进教室都会再度发现， 一个老师在期望学生全神贯注之前，他必须先吸引学生的注意力，无论附 近有什么分散注意力的东西。要做到这点，有很多种办法，它们与教学风格有很大的关系。然 而，单靠风格无法起效，有另一个办法可以显示谁是在教室里掌握胜局的人。这个办法就是亮出失败的王牌。

I will never forget a teacher who played that card to get the attention of one of my children.Our youngest, a **world-class charmer,** did little to develop his intellectual talents but always **got by**. Until Mrs. Stifter.

我永远也忘不了一位老师亮出那张王牌以吸引我的一个孩子的注意。我的小儿子是个世 界级的**万人迷**，学习不怎么动脑筋却总能**蒙混过关**。直到施蒂夫特夫人当了他的老师，这种局面才彻底改变了。

Our son was a high-school senior when he had her for English.“He sits in the back of the room talking to his friends,"she told me.“Why don't you move him to the front row?" I urged, believing the embarrassment would get him to settle down. Mrs.Stifter looked at me **steely**-eyed over her glasses.“I don't move seniors," she said."I **flunk** them." I was **flustered**. Our son's academic life flashed before my eyes. No teacher had ever threatened him with that before. I regained my **composure** and managed to say that I thought she was right. By the time I got home I was feeling pretty good about this. It was a **radical** approach for these times, but, well, why not?“She's going to flunk you," I told my son. I did not discuss it any further. Suddenly English became a priority in his life.He finished out the semester with an A.

当她教我儿子英语时，我儿子是一个高中高年级学生。“他坐在后排和他的朋友说话。”她 告诉我。“你为什么不把他换到前排来?”我恳求道。我相信令他难堪的做法会让他安心学习。 施蒂夫特夫人从眼镜上方**冷冷地**看着我。“我不会换高年级学生的座位。”她说，“我会给他们**不及格**的成绩。”我**大感紧张**。我们儿子的学习生涯在我的眼前闪现。之前，没有老师以此威 胁过他。我恢复**镇定**，艰难地表示我认为她是对的。到家时，我对此感觉良好。目前这是一种**激进**的做法，但是，嗯，为什么不这么做呢?“她要给你不及格。”我告诉我的儿子。我没 有再多说什么。突然英语就在他的生活中成了头等大事。他期末得了一个A。

I know one example doesn't make a case, but at night school I see a **parade** of students who are angry and resentful for having been passed along until they could no longer even **pretend to keep up**. Of average intelligence or better, they eventually quit school, concluding they were too **dumb** to finish. “I should have been held back,”is a comment I hear frequently. Even sadder are those students who are high school graduates who say to me after a few weeks of class," I don't know how I ever got a high-school **diploma**."

我知道一个例子不能说明问题，但我在夜校中看见了**一群**愤怒、怨恨的学生，他们愤恨 的原因是学校让他们一路混，直到他们甚至都无法再**假装跟得上**。这些学生智力水平至少也算中等，但最终都退学了，他们总结说自己太**笨**，学不下去了。我最常听见的话是：“我本应该被留级。”更悲哀的是那些高中毕业生在上课几周后对我说：“我都不知道自己是怎么拿到高中**文凭**的。”

Passing students who have not mastered the work cheats them and the employers who expect graduates to have basic skills. We **excuse** this dishonest behavior by saying kids can't learn if they come from terrible environments. No one seems to stop to think that —no matter what environments they come from—most kids don't put school first on their list unless they **perceive** something is **at stake**. They'd rather be **sailing.**

让没有掌握本领的学生通过考核，既欺骗了他们，也欺骗了期望毕业生拥有基本技能的雇主。我们为这种不诚实的行为**辩解**说，如果孩子们来自糟糕的环境，他们就不会学习。似乎没有人停下来想想看，无论孩子们来自何种环境，他们当中大多数若不是**发现**情况**到了危急关头**，才不会把功课当作头等大事呢。他们宁可**混日子**。

Many students I see at night could give **expert testimony** on unemployment, chemical dependency, **abusive relationships**. Inspite of these difficulties, they have decided to make education a priority. They are motivated by the desire for a better job or the need to hang on to the one they've got. **They have a healthy fear of failure**.

我在晚上所教的许多学生都能在失业、毒品依赖和**滥交**问题上给出**专家证词**。尽管有这些困难，他们还是决定把接受教育放在首位。渴望找到一份更好的工作，或者是需要保住他 们现有的工作，促使他们这么做。**他们对失败有着健康的恐惧（这里健康的意思更多是表明这种恐惧是积极的有益的）**。

People of all ages can **rise above** their problems, but they need to have a reason to do so. Young people generally don't have the **maturity** to value education in the same way my adult students value it. But fear of failure, whether economic or academic, can motivate both.

各个年龄的人都能**克服**他们的问题，可他们需要一个这样做的理由。年轻人往往不够**成熟**，不会像我的成人学生们那样重视教育。但是对于失败的恐惧，无论这种恐惧是经济方面 的还是学术方面的，都能对年轻人和成年人起到激励作用。

Flunking as a regular policy has just as much **merit** today as it did two generations ago. We must review the threat of flunking and see it as it really is 一 a positive teaching tool. It is an expression of confidence by both teachers and parents that the students have the ability to learn the material presented to them. However, making it work again would **take a dedicated, caring conspiracy** between teachers and parents. It would mean facing the tough reality that passing kids who haven't learned the material — while it might save them grief for the short term — **dooms** them to long-term **illiteracy**. It would mean that teachers would have to follow through on their threats, and parents would have to stand behind them, knowing their children's best **interests** are indeed at stake. This means no more doing Scott's assignments for him because he might fail. No more passing Jodi because she's such a nice kid.

让学生不及格，作为一种常规手段，其**优点**在今天依然和两代之前一样多。我们必须重新考虑不及格的威胁，并客观地看待它—它是一种积极的教学手段。这表明老师和家长都对学生有信心，相信他们能够学好发给他们的学习材料。然而，让这种手段重新起效，需要教师和父母**同心协力（善良的谎言）**，一起来关心学生。这意味着要面对一个严酷的现实，即让没有学会知识的孩子通过考试 虽然从短期看可以让他们免受痛苦——却**注定**会让他们长期饱受**不会读写之苦（文盲）**。这意味着老师必须对他们发出的威胁坚持到底，父母必须站在老师身后给予支持，明 白他们孩子的最大**利益**正濒临危险。这意味着再也不要因为担心斯科特会不及格而替他做作业，再也不要因为朱迪是个乖孩子就放她过关。

This is a policy that worked in the past and can work today. A wise teacher, with the support of his parents, gave our son the opportunity to succeed — or fail. It's time we return this choice to all students.

这是一个在过去有效，在今天也会有效的政策。 一位英明的老师，在我们做父母的支持下，给了我们的儿子一个机会——成功或失败。现在是我们把这个选择权还给所有学生的时候了。

### B：教育的本质

The essence of education is the teaching of facts and **reasoning skills** to our children, so that they learn to think.

教育的本质是向我们的孩子们教授事实和**推理技能**，让他们学会思考

Yet almost a century, our schools have been under **assault** by an approach to education that **elevates** feelings over facts. Under the influence of Progressive Education' — It is now more important than getting him in touch with the facts of history, mathematics or geography.

然而，差不多一个世纪以来，我们的学校都在受到一种将感受**凌驾**于事实之上的教育方法的**攻击**。在进步教育的影响下——让学生了解历史事实、数学或地理似乎都不如感觉重要。

“Creative spelling”—in which students are encouraged to spell words in whatever way they feel is correct —is more important than the rules of language. Urging children to “feel good”about themselves is more important than ensuring that they acquire the knowledge necessary for living successfully.

“创造性的拼写”——鼓励学生以任何他们感觉正确的方式拼写单词——这比语言规则更 为重要。鼓动孩子对他们自己“感觉良好”比确保他们获得顺利生活所必需的知识更为重要。

This emotion-centered, **anti-reason** **assault** on education has found a new **ally**:those who believe the **literal words of the Bible**. The Kansas **Board of Education** has just **excised** the theory of evolution from the state's official science standards. Several other states have **enacted** similar anti-evolution policies, thereby **elevating** the feeling of **religious fundamentalists** over the accumulated evidence of the entire science of biology.

这种以情绪为中心、**反对理性**的对教育**的攻击**已经找到了新的**同盟军**：那些相信**圣经上的文字**的人。堪萨斯州**教育理事会**刚刚**推翻**了该州官方科学标准中的进化论。其他几个州也**颁布**了类似的反进化政策，从而将**宗教原教旨主义者**的感受**凌驾**于整个生物科学所积累起的证据之上

These policies do not actually ban the teaching of evolution, nor do they **mandate** the teaching of“**Creationism**?”—the **biblical** claim that the Earth and all life on it were created in six days. They simply drop evolution from the **required curriculum**. The goal of the **religious** activities is to keep students ignorant of the theory of evolution, or to encourage the teaching of evolution and Creationism side-by-side, as two“competing”theories.

这些政策实际上并不禁止教授进化论，它们也不**命令**教授“**特创论**”——**圣经**上说地球和地球上所有的生命都是在六天之内被创造出来的。它们只是把进化论排除在**必修课程**之外。 **宗教**活动的目的是让学生对进化论保持无知，或是鼓励同时教授进化论和特创论，把它们作 为两个互相竞争的理论。

Consider what this latter would mean in the classroom. On the one side, teachers would present the theory of evolution, supported by countless observations, all **integrated into** a comprehensive explanation of virtually every fact in its field.

思考一下后一种做法在教室里将意味着什么吧。 一方面，老师们会讲解进化论， 一个被无数观察所支持、**整合**了对领域内每一个方面的解释的综合理论。

On the other side, teachers would present —what? All that the **Creationist view** offers is the **assertion** by **would-be authorities** that an ancient religious text reveals that 10,000 years ago God created the world in six days.

另一方面，老师们会讲解——什么? **特创论信奉者的观点**只是**自诩为权威**的人的**断言**，即一部古老的宗教文本揭示了10,000年以前，上帝在六天内创造了世界。

Some of these religious activists claim that they reject the teaching of evolution because it is "unproven," since it lacks “sufficient evidence.”

这些宗教激进主义分子中的一部分人宣称他们反对教授进化论，因为它“未经证明”,由 于它缺乏“充分的证据”。

Yet their arguments systematically reject the need for proof and evidence. Scientists can point to a billion-year-long **fossil** record of continuous changes across all species as they develop from more-**primitive** to present-day forms. They can point to the **natural variations** among members of a species, variations that change from one **climate** to another as species adapt to their environment. But the Creationist **categorically dismisses** the evidence — because it **contradicts** biblical **dogma.**

然而，他们的论点恰好系统地反对检验和证据的需要。科学家们可以指向十亿年来的**化石**记录，它记载了所有物种从较**原始**的形体发展到现今的形态所经历的持续变化。他们可以指向同一物种内各个成员间的**自然变异**，那些物种为适应环境、随**气候**所发生的变异。但是特创论的信奉者**无条件地拒绝**接受证据——因为证据与圣经**教义矛盾**。

The **central issue** is not whether there is enough scientific evidence to validate a **particular conclusion** — but whether science **as such**, rather than **faith**, is the basis for arriving at conclusions. There can be no **scientific debate** between these two positions. There can be no **rational argument** between a view that **rests** on observation and reason, and one that rests on blind faith — i.e., on its **adherents'** desire to believe something, **irrespective of logic**.

**最根本的问题**不在于是否有足够的科学证据来确认某个**特定的结论**—而在于科学**本身**， 而非**信仰**，是否是得出结论的基础。这两个立场间不可能有任何**科学的辩论**。 一个观点**依靠**观察和推理，另一个观点依靠盲目的信仰——即依靠其**追随者**相信某件事的愿望，**不考虑逻辑**，这两种观点之间不可能有**理性的辩论**。

If the Creationist approach were taken seriously, what would remain of education? If evidence and reasoning are to be "balanced" by faith or feeling 一 what, then, would not belong in the curriculum?Even the theory that the Earth is **flat** has **proponents** who feel it is true. More to the point, what is to stop teachers from presenting any other **nonrational** view of the origin of man? Why not give equal time to, say, the Nazi claim the white race **descended from the superior Aryans?**

假如特创论的观点被当真，那教育将剩下些什么?如果证据和推理要被信仰或感受所平 衡——那么, 什么将不属于课程的一部分? 连地球是**平**的这样的理论都有**支持者**认为它是正确 的。此外，什么将阻止老师讲解其他关于人类起源的**非理性**观点?为什么不用同样的时间来 讲解诸如纳粹认为白种人是**源自高等的雅利安人的观点?**

The **most ominous** **implication** of the Creationist **position** is its belief that, in judging the truth of an idea, one can simply ignore rational evidence— if it clashes with one's **desire to believe otherwise**. This is a **disastrous** methodology to **inculcate** in our children — and it is even more dangerous to **back it up** with the **ruling** of a government body.

特创论**立场最坏的暗示**是它相信在判断一个想法的真实性时， 一个人可以完全无视理性的证据——只要它与一个人**相信其他事情的愿望**有所冲突。把这样的方法论**灌输**给我们的孩子是**灾难性的**，而用政府组织的**统治**来**支持**这种方法论，则更是危险。

The crucial role of education is to provide young people with the information and methods they need in order to learn how to think independently. Education has **liberated mankind** from the **shackles** of myth, **superstition** and **unchallenged tradition**. But the **prevailing trend** —from both the“progressive left" and the "religious right" — is to reverse this development, by **enshrining** feeling over facts and faith over reason.

教育极其重要的任务就是为年轻人提供他们学会独立思考所需要的信息和方法。教育把 **人类**从神话、**迷信**和**未受质疑**的**传统**中**解放**出来。但现在**普遍的倾向**—从“进步左翼”和 “宗教右翼”两方面来看——都在把感受**凌驾**于事实之上、把信仰凌驾于理性之上，这样做是 在倒转发展的方向。

If campaigns such as the one against teaching evolution are allowed to succeed, the **ultimate** result will be the extinction of **genuine** education.

如果类似反对教授进化论的运动被获准取得成功，**最终**的结果将是**真正**的教育的灭绝。

## Unit 3

### A：追寻烟草的历程：从性感到致命

For many Americans, the tobacco industry's **disingenuousness** became a matter of public record during a **Congressional hearing** on April 14,1994.There, under the **withering glare** of Representative Henry A.Waxman, **Democrat** of California, appeared the **chief executives** of the seven largest American tobacco companies.

对许多美国人来说，烟草业的**不诚信**记入公众档案始于1994年4月14日的一次**国会听证会**。在加州**民主党**代表亨利·A· 韦克斯曼的**怒视**下，美国七大烟草巨头的**首席执行官**出现在了这次听证会上。

In the 1930s and 1940s, cigarettes were either healthy because they were **implicitly endorsed** by a kindly doctor, or sexy.

在20世纪30和40年代，香烟要么意味着健康——因为有一位仁慈的医生**含蓄地推荐**它，要么就意味着性感。

Each executive raised his right hand and solemnly swore to tell the whole truth about his business. In **sequential testimony,** each one stated that he did not believe tobacco was a health risk and that his company had taken no steps to **manipulate** the levels of **nicotine** in its cigarettes.

每位总裁举起右手，郑重宣誓要对从事的业务实话实说。在**随后的证词**中，每个人都陈述自己不相信烟草会给健康带来风险，而且自己的公司从未采取措施来**操纵**香烟中尼古丁的 含量。

Thirty years after the famous **surgeon general's report** declaring cigarette smoking a **health hazard**, the tobacco executives, it seemed, were among the few who **believed otherwise**.

30年前， 一位**卫生局长**就发布了关于抽烟**危害健康**的著名报告。如今看来，烟草业总裁们属于**不相信**该报告的极少数人的行列。

But it was not always that way. Allan M.Brandt, a **medical historian at Harvard**, insists that recognizing the dangers of cigarettes **resulted** from an **intellectual process** that took the **better part** of the 20th century. He describes this **fascinating** story in his new book, The Cigarette Century：The Rise, Fall and **Deadly Persistence** of the Product that Defined America (Basic Books).

但事实并非始终如此。**哈佛大学医学史专家** 艾伦·M ·布兰特 坚持认为，对香烟危害的认识**源于**持续了**大半个**20世纪的一个**智力过程**。在新书《香烟的世纪：界定美国的产品的兴衰和**死命的坚持**》中，他讲述了这个**引人入胜**的故事。

**In contrast to** the symbol of death and disease it is today, from the early 1900s to the 1960s the cigarette was a cultural icon of **sophistication**, **glamour** and **sexual allure** — a highly **prized commodity** for one out of two Americans.

（相反的是）虽说当今香烟是死亡和疾病的象征，但从20世纪初到20世纪60年代，香烟在文化上象 征着**成熟**练达、**魅力**和**性感诱惑** —— 是当时半数美国人**大为追捧**的商品。

Many advertising campaigns from the 1930s through the 1950s **extolled** the **healthy virtues** of cigarettes. Full-color magazine ads depicted kindly doctors **clad** in white coats proudly **lighting up or puffing away**, with **slogans** like“More doctors smoke Camels than any other cigarettes.”

从20世纪30年代到50年代，许多广告运动都**颂扬**香烟的**健康品质**。在全彩的杂志广告中，**身穿**白大褂的仁慈的医生骄傲地**点起香烟或是吞云吐雾**，上面还写着“更多医生选择骆驼牌香烟”之类的**广告语**。

Early in the 20th century, **opposition** to cigarettes took a moral rather than a health-conscious **tone**, especially for women who wanted to smoke, although even then many doctors were concerned that smoking was a health risk.

20世纪初期，对香烟的**抵制**带着道德的**口吻**，而不是出于对健康的关注。对想抽烟的女性更是如此。不过即使在当时，许多医生已经关注到吸烟会给健康造成风险。

The 1930s were a period when many Americans began smoking and the most significant health effects had not yet developed. As a result, the **scientific studies of the era** often failed to find clear evidence of serious **pathology** and had the **perverse** effect of **exonerating** the cigarette.

在20世纪30年代这一时期，许多美国人变成了烟民，而抽烟对健康最为显著的危害尚未显现出来。因此，**这一时期的科学研究**无法从严肃的**病理学**上找到清晰的证据，竟起到了为香烟**开脱**的**反效果**

The years after World War II, however, were a time of major breakthroughs in **epidemiological** thought. In 1947, Richard Doll and A.Bradford Hill of the **British Medical Research Council** created a **sophisticated statistical technique** to document the association between rising rates of lung cancer and increasing numbers of smokers.

到了二战后，**流行病学**思想取得了不少重大突破。1947年，**英国医学研究会**的理查德 · 多尔和A· 布拉德福德·希尔创立了一种**复杂的统计方法**，以记录肺癌上升率和烟民增加之 间的联系。

The **prominent** surgeon Evarts A.Graham and a **medical student**, Ernst L. Wynder, published a **landmark** article in 1950 comparing the incidence of lung cancer in their nonsmoking and smoking patients at Barnes Hospital in St.Louis. They concluded that “**cigarette smoking, over a long period**, is at least one important factor in the striking increase in **bronchogenic** **cancer.**”

**著名**外科医生埃瓦茨·A· 格雷厄姆和**医学专业学生**欧内斯特·L·温德尔于1950年发表 了一篇极为重要的论文，比较了圣路易斯市巴恩斯医院内烟民和非烟民肺癌患者的发生机率。 在结论中，他们认为“**长期抽烟**至少是**支气管癌**发病率飙升的重要因素之一。”

**Predictably**, the tobacco companies — and their expert **surrogates** **— derided** these and other studies as **mere** statistical arguments or **anecdotes** rather than **definitions of causality**.

**不难想象**，烟草公司以及他们的专家**代言人**们**嘲笑**这些以及其它研究，称这些**仅仅**是统计上的论据或**趣闻轶事**，根本不能**确定其因果关系**。

Dr.Brandt, who has **exhaustively** **combed** through the tobacco companies' internal **memorandums** and research documents, **amply** demonstrates that Big Tobacco understood many of the health risks of their products long before the 1964 surgeon general's report.

在**详细梳理**了烟草公司的内部**备忘录**和研究文档后，布兰特博士用**充足**的证据证明，早在1964年的卫生局长报告发表前，各大烟草巨头就已了解了自家产品对健康造成的诸多风险。

He also describes the **concerted disinformation** **campaigns** these companies **waged** for more than half a century — **simultaneously obfuscating** scientific evidence and spreading the belief that since everyone knew cigarettes were dangerous at some level, smoking was essentially an issue of personal choice and responsibility rather than a **corporate one**.

他还描述了这些公司在半个多世纪以来， 一直**合谋炮制假消息**，**同时混淆**科学证据，散布这种论调：既然大家都知道香烟在一定程度上有危害，抽烟与否从根本上说是个人的选择和责任问题，责任不在**烟草公司**。

In the 1980s, scientists established the **revolutionary** concept that nicotine is extremely **addictive**. The tobacco companies publicly rejected such claims, even as they took advantage of cigarettes' addictive potential by routinely **spiking(偷偷的加料)** them with extra nicotine to make it harder to quit smoking. And their **marketing memorandums** document(v) advertising campaigns aimed at youngsters to hook whole new generations of smokers.

在20世纪80年代，科学家们建立了一种**革命性**的观念，即尼古丁具有极强的**致瘾性**。虽说烟草公司公开否认这些说法，但当时他们已经利用香烟的致瘾性来赚钱了，他们加大尼古丁含量，将烟民勾住，使得戒烟愈发困难。在他们的**营销备忘录**中，记录了他们针对青少年 发动的广告运动，旨在诱惑一代代的新烟民。

In 2004, Dr.Brandt was **recruited** by the **Department of Justice** to serve as its **star expert** witness in the federal **racketeering** case against Big Tobacco and to counter the **gaggle** of witnesses recruited by the industry. According to their own **testimony**, most of the 29 historians testifying on **behalf(利益)** of Big Tobacco did not even **consult** the industry's internal research or **communications**. Instead, these experts focused primarily on a small group of **skeptics** of the dangers of cigarettes during the 1950s, many of whom had or would eventually have **ties** to the tobacco industry.

2004年，布兰特博士被**司法部 聘请**为**重要专家**，在指控烟草巨头的联邦**欺诈**案件中作证， 并与烟草业雇佣来的**一伙**证人进行对质。根据为烟草巨头们出庭作证的29位历史学家们自己的**供述**，他们中大多数甚至没有**参看**过烟草业内部的研究或**交流文档**。相反，这些专家主要 关注的是20世纪50年代的一小撮对香烟危害的**怀疑论者**，他们中的大部分人要么当时就与烟草业有**勾结**，要么最终也会同烟草业勾结起来。

“I was **appalled** by what the tobacco expert witnesses had written,”Dr.Brandt said in a recent interview.“By asking narrow questions and responding to them with narrow research, they provided precisely the **cover** the industry sought.”

布兰特博士在近期一次专访中说：“这些专家证人写下的言论令我感到**震惊**。他们靠问一 些片面的问题，并用片面的研究来解答，从而为烟草业提供了他们恰好需要的**挡箭牌**。”

Apparently, the judge, Gladys Kessler of **Federal District Court** for the District of Columbia, agreed. Last August, she concluded that the tobacco industry had **engaged** in a 40-year **conspiracy** to **defraud** smokers about tobacco's health dangers. Her opinion cited Dr.Brandt's testimony more than 100 times.

显然，哥伦比亚特区**联邦地方法庭法官**格拉迪丝·凯斯勒同意这一看法。去年八月，她总结道，烟草业**策划**了一场长达40年的**阴谋**，向烟民**隐瞒**烟草对健康的危害。她的观点中引用布兰特博士的证词达100多次。

Dr.Brandt **acknowledges** that there are **pitfalls** in combining **scholarship** with battle against the deadly **pandemic** of cigarette smoking, but he says he sees little alternative.

布兰特博士**承认**，将**学术研究**和与抽烟这种致命的世界性**传染病**作斗争结合起来，这当中会有**陷阱**，但他说他几乎看不到有别的选择。

“If one of us occasionally crosses the boundary between analysis and **advocacy,** so be it,”he said.“The **stakes** are high, and there is much work to be done.”

“如果我们中有人偶然跨过了分析和**倡导**之间的边界，那就跨过吧。”他说。“**风险**很大， 还有很多工作要做。”

### B：潜入心灵的营销

Are you a Coke' or Pepsi drinker? Do you **pull into** McDonald's golden arches or prefer to“have it your way”at **Burger King**?? When it comes to **toothpaste**, which **flavor** gets you brushing, **Colgate or Crest**? If you think it's just your **taste buds** that guide these preferences, you may be surprised by what **neuroscientists** are discovering when they **peer inside** the brain as it makes everyday choices like these.

你喝可口可乐或百事可乐吗?你有没有驾车**驶入**麦当劳金色的拱门?你是不是偏爱在 “**汉堡王**”餐厅“让我做主”? 谈到**牙膏**，哪种**口味**会让你刷牙?是**高露洁还是佳洁士**?如果 你觉得仅仅是**味蕾**指导着这些喜好的话，那么看看神经科学家们通过**窥视**大脑做出这类日常决策后的发现吧，你也许会大吃一惊。

Don't worry —no one's scanning your head as you stand in front of the **beverage aisle** or sit in line at the drive-through. Instead, brain scientists are asking volunteers to **ponder** purchasing choices while lying inside high-tech brain scanners. The resulting real-time images indicate where and how the brain analyzes options, weighs risks and rewards, factors in experiences and emotions and ultimately sets a **preference**.“We can use brain imaging to gain insight into the mechanisms behind people's decisions in a way that is often difficult to get at simply by asking a person or watching their behavior," says Dr.Gregory Berns, a **psychiatrist** at Emory University.

别担心——当你站在**饮料货架**前或是在免下车餐厅前排队时，没有人在扫描你的大脑。脑 科学家们的办法是，让志愿者躺在高科技脑扫描仪下，**思考**采购决策。扫描产生的实时图像 表明了大脑在何处以何种方式分析各选项，掂量风险和回报、经验和情感中的诸因素，并最终确定自己的**偏好**。艾摩利大学**精神医生**格雷戈里·伯恩斯博士说：“我们使用脑扫描方式来了解人做决策的机制，这种机制靠询问别人或观察其行为是很难被发现的。”

To scientists, it's all part of the larger question of how the human brain makes decisions. But the answers may be **invaluable** to Big Business, which invested an estimated $8 billion in 2006 into market research in an effort to predict — **and sway** — how we would spend our money. In the past, marketers relied on relatively crude measures of what got us buying：**focus-group** questionnaires and measurements of eye movements and **perspiration** patterns (the more excited you get about something, the more you tend to **sweat**). Now researchers can go straight to the decider in chief — the brain itself, opening the door to a **controversial** new field **dubbed** neuromarketing'.

对于科学家来说，它只是人类大脑如何做决策这个大问题的一部分而已。但对于大型企业来说，问题的答案可能是**极为宝贵**的。据估计，2006年，这些企业在市场研究上投入了80 亿美元，以预测——**并改变**——我们花钱的方式。过去，营销专家要了解影响我们购买的因素， 靠的是相对粗糙的手段：**目标群体**问卷调查，测量目光移动和**出汗**模式(你对某事物越是兴 奋，就越容易**出汗**)。现在，研究者们可以直接探入决策的主脑—大脑本身，由此打开了一 扇大门，进入了一个被**命名**为神经营销学的**复杂（有争议的）**的新领域。

For now, most of the research is purely academic, although even brain experts anticipate that it's just a matter of time before their findings become **a routine part of any smart corporation's marketing plans**. Some lessons, particularly about how the brain **interprets** brand names, are already **enticing** advertisers. Take, for example, the classic taste test. P.Read Montague of Baylor College of Medicine performed his version of the Pepsi Challenge inside a **functional magnetic resonance imaging(fMRI)** machine in 2004. Montague gave 67 people a blind taste test of both Coke and Pepsi, then placed his **subjects** in the scanner, whose **magnetic field** measures how active cells are by recording how much oxygen they consume for energy. After tasting each drink, all the volunteers showed strong activation of the reward areas of the brain — which are associated with pleasure and satisfaction —and they were almost **evenly** split in their preferences for the two brands. But when Montague repeated the test and told them what they were drinking, three out of four people said they preferred Coke, and their brains showed why：not only were the reward systems active, but memory regions in the **medial prefrontal cortex** and **hippocampus** also lit up. "This showed that the brand alone has value in the brain system **above and beyond** the desire for the content of the **can**,” says Montague.In other words, all those happy, energetic and **glamorous** people drinking Coke in **commercials** did exactly what they were supposed to do: **seeped** into the brain and **left associations so powerful** they could even override a preference for the taste of Pepsi.

迄今，这项研究基本上是纯学术性的，不过脑科学专家预计，早晚有一天他们的发现会被所有**明智的企业**所采纳，**成为其营销方案中的常规部分**。部分课程，尤其是关于大脑如何**解读**商标名称的课程，已经令广告商们**大为感兴趣**，例如经典的味觉测试。2004年，Baylor 医学院的P·里德·蒙塔古利用**功能性核磁共振成像仪(fMRI)** 进行了他的“百事挑战活动”。蒙塔古让67个人在不知情的情况下分别品尝了可口可乐和百事可乐并进行测试，然后让**受试者** 躺在扫描仪下，扫描仪的**磁场**通过记录获得能量所需的耗氧量，测出细胞的活跃程度。品尝了两种饮料后，所有志愿者脑部与愉悦和满意情绪相联系的奖励区域均显示出较强的激活，在 对两种品牌的喜好中，志愿者人数几乎是**半对半**。但当蒙塔古将测试重复进行并告诉了他们 所喝的是何种饮料时，四个人中有三个说他们更喜欢可口可乐，他们的大脑揭示了其中奥妙： 不仅奖励系统活跃起来，而且**中央前额皮层**和**海马区**的记忆区域也点亮了。“这表明品牌本身 在大脑系统中具有的价值已经**高于并超出**了对**罐中饮料**的欲求。”换句话说，**广告片**里那些喝 着可口可乐，看起来快乐、生机勃勃、**魅力四射**的人们圆满完成了交给他们的任务：**渗入**观众大脑中，**引起了强烈的联想**，甚至盖过了对百**事可乐的味道的偏好。**

Stanford neuroscientist Brian Knutson has **zeroed** in on a more **primitive aspect** of making choices.“We **come equipped to assess** potentially good things and potentially bad things," he says. "There should be stuff in your brain that promotes your survival, whether you have learned those things or not —such as being scared of the dark or the unknown.”Knutson calls these **anticipatory emotions**, and he believes that even before the **cognitive areas** of the brain are brought in to **assess options**, these more **intuitive** and emotional regions are already **priming** the decision-making process and can **foreshadow** the outcome. Such primitive triggers almost certainly afforded survival advantages to our **ancestors** when they decided which plants to pick or which **caves** to enter, but Knutson **surmises** that **vestiges** of this system are at work as we make more **mundane choices** at the **mall**. There, it's the **match** between the value of a product and its price that triggers an **anticipation** of pleasure or pain.

斯坦福大学神经科学家布赖恩·克努森**专注于**做选择时较为**原始的一面**。他说，“我们**生来俱有某种机制来判断**哪些可能是有益的东西，哪些可能是有害的东西。你的头脑里应该有 某种东西来提高你的生存能力，不管你学没学过——例如怕黑、害怕未知事物等。”克努森把 这些叫做“**期望情感**”,他相信甚至在大脑的**认知区域**介入**选项的分析**前，这些更接近**直觉**、 更感性的区域已经为决策过程作了**准备**，并能够**预测**到结果。当我们的**祖先**在判断去采哪株 植物或是进入哪个**洞穴**时，这种原始的诱发因素几乎肯定为他们的生存带来了益处，但克努森**推测**，当我们在**商场**里做出一些**日常选择**时，这一系统的**残余部分**发挥了作用。在商场里 正是商品价值和价格之间的**较量**诱发了愉悦或痛苦的**期望**。

To test his theory, Knutson and his team **devised** a way to **mimic** these same **intuitive reactions** in the lab. He gave subjects $20 each and, while they were in the fMRI machine, presented them with pictures of 80 products, each followed by a price. Subjects then had the option of purchasing each item on display. As they viewed products they preferred, Knutson saw activity in the **nucleus accumbens** , a region of the brain involved in anticipating pleasant outcomes. If, on the other hand, the subjects thought the price of these items was too high, there was increased activity in the **insula** — an area involved in anticipating pain.“The idea is that if you can look into people's brains right before they make certain decisions, you can get a handle on these two feelings and do a better job of predicting what they are about to do, "Knutson says.“ I believe anticipatory emotions not only bias but drive decision making.”

为了检验他的理论，克努森和他的研究小组**设计**了一种在实验室环境中**模拟**同样**直觉反应**的方法。他给了受试者每人20美元，当受试者躺在fMRI 扫描仪下时，他给受试者观看80 种产品的图片，每种图片后附有其价格。然后受试者可以选择购买每一种展示的物品。当他们审视着他们喜欢的产品时，克努森看到**伏隔核**的活动(伏隔核是一片预感愉悦结果的脑部区域)。另一方面，如果受试者认为这些物品的价格太高，**脑岛**部位的活动就会增强，而脑岛是 预感痛苦的脑部区域。“我们的想法是，如果你能够在人们做出某些决策之前，看穿他们的脑部活动，你就能够控制这两种情绪，更好地预测他们即将做出的决策。”克努森说。“我相信期望情感不仅使决策产生偏移，而且对决策产生推动作用。”

All of this, of course, is **whirring** along at the brain's **split-second pace**, and as imaging technology improves, Knutson is hopeful that he and others will be able to see in even more detail the **circuits(可不翻译，就是脑回路的意思)** in the brain activated during a decision. Already, according to Montague, these images have revealed surprising things about how the brain **pares down** the decision-making process by setting up short-cuts to make its analysis more efficient. To save time, the brain doesn't **run through the laundry list** of risks, benefits and value judgments each time. **Whenever it can**, it relies on a type of “quick key”that takes advantage of experiences and stored information. That's where things like brands, familiarity and trust come in — they're a **shortcut** for knowing what to expect. "You run from the **devil** you know," says Montague. "And you run to the brand that you know, because to sit there and **deliberate chews up time**, and that makes you less efficient than the next guy.”

当然，这些活动都在大脑**电光火石的瞬间进行的**。随着成像技术的改良，克努森相信他和其他科学家们将会了解到**决策过程**中大脑兴奋区域的更多细节。据蒙塔古称，这些图像已 经揭示了许多令人吃惊的事实，说明了大脑如何**削减**决策过程，建立捷径，提高决策分析的 效率。为节省时间，大脑并不每次都对风险、益处和价值判断**进行一一分析**。**只要可能的话**，大脑都依赖一种对以往经验和存储的信息加以利用的“快捷键”。这就是品牌、熟悉度和信任 介入的地方——它们是了解所期望事物的**捷径**。蒙塔古说，“你远离**未知**的东西，走向你了解的品牌，因为坐在那儿**认真思考太耗时间**，会让你比旁边那家伙要低效。”

That's certainly music to advertisers' ears, but, **warn neuroscientists**, it's unlikely that our purchasing behavior follows a single pathway. Montague, for one, is investigating how factors like trust, **altruism** and the feeling of **obligation** when **someone does you a favor** can **divert and modify** steps in the decision-making tree. “The capacity to use brain responses and relate them to behavior has accelerated at a **breathtaking pace** over the past four years and yielded an incredible amount of information.”he says. How marketers use that data to **hone** their messages remains to be seen.

对于广告商来说，这种说法当然很美妙，但**神经科学家警告**说，我们的购买行为不可能遵循单一的方式。例如，蒙塔古正在研究当**别人帮助你**时，信任、**利他**和**责任感**等因素如何 **转移并修改**决策结构图中的各步骤。他说，“利用大脑反应并将它们与行为关联起来的能力在 过去的四年中取得了**令人惊叹的巨大进步**，产生了令人难以置信的海量信息。”营销专家如何 使用这种信息来**改进**他们的讯息传播，令人拭目以待。

## Unit 5

### A：亚里士多德是对的

Well-being, not just wealth, should mark the progress of our societies. It is hard to escape the fact that in developed societies, despite progress, **innovation** and prosperity ,**there is something not quite right**. In some cases,it is hard for people to put a finger on it：a feeling of emptiness and not belonging, a lack of **defined** relationships and solid social structures. In other respects, it is really **quantifiable:** rates of drug abuse, violent crime and depression and suicide are **rocketing.** Why are we so unhappy? It seems that the **Enlightenment** brought forth **unparalleled liberty** in economic, social and political life, but we are now undergoing a midlife crisis.

人们身心的健康与快乐，并非财富，才是我们社会进步的标志。人们很难摆脱这样一种事实：在发达的社会，尽管社会进步，改革日新月异，物质富足、却总觉得**有些事情不大对劲**。有时候，人们难以明确地指出到底为何：空虚，没有归属感，没有**稳定明确**的人际关系以及稳固的社会结构。在其他方面，问题可以明确**量化**地表述：滥用毒品、暴力犯罪，经济萧条以及自杀身亡的比率在**急剧增加**。我们为何如此不快乐？**启蒙运动**带给我们**无可比拟**的经济、社会以及政治生活的**自由**，而我们现在正经受着“中年”危机。

**The politics of happiness is nothing new**. In his Nicomachean Ethics, Aristotle said that **eudaimonia**', or happiness, is the goal of life. But for me, the person who brings the great **conundrum** of personal happiness alive is Robert Kennedy. In a beautifully **crafted** speech, he said what “makes life worthwhile" is "the health of our children, the quality of their education, the joy of their play," "the strength of our marriages … our devotion to our country”and our“**wit** .…wisdom and courage.” And he pointed out that none of these could be measured by **gross national product**⁸ .

**探讨幸福的内涵古已有之**。在其所著的《尼各马科伦理学》一书中，亚里士多德曾指出：**幸福**是人生的目标。可我以为，将个人幸福这一难题谈得**沸沸扬扬**的是罗伯特·肯尼迪，在他言辞精妙的演讲中，他阐述道：使“生活有意义“的是“孩于们的健康，儿童的教育质量以及他们玩耍游戏的快乐”，是“我们德固的婚姻.....对祖国的热爱与忠诚”，是我们的“**睿智**.......英明与勇气”。他还指出，这一切没有一样能够用**国民生产总值**来街量。

Nor could we be surprised by the **politics** **of happiness**. Ask people how they are, and they will answer in terms of their family life, community life and work life, rather than just what they are paid.

我们也不会对**幸福内涵**感到惊讶。若问人们近况知何，他们会谈到家庭、工 作以及所处社区的情况，而不是回答自己挣多少工资。

Despite this, it is a **notoriously difficult subject** for politicians to grasp. One reason is that happiness and well-being are generally not well **served** by statistical analysis. Politicians, **obsessed with** inputs and outputs, targets and controls, are **flummoxed** by immeasurable concepts such as the value people place on spending time with their families. Another reason, which is related, is that **electoral cycles** lend themselves to a culture of **short-termism**, with a need for immediate, quantifiable measurements and results.

即使这样，政治家们还是难以完全理解这一**众所周知的难题**——幸福的确切内涵。其中之一的原因是幸福与健康通常都不能通过统计分析来**表示**。政治家们**满脑子**的投入与产出、目标与调控，而对于诸如人们有多看重与家人共度时光之类的、无法用数字测量的概念，他们往往感到**困惑不已**。另一与之相关的原因是：**一轮轮的竞选**让他们置身于**急功近利**的氛围，期待立竿见影的、量化的测量手段与结果

One such measurement is GDP. In many ways, increasing this has been the raison d'etre for many center-right political parties since the 1980s. **Back then**, many developed economics were in a state of economic **malaise,** with persistently high inflation and unemployment. We needed something to reverse this **stagnation** and put us back onto the path of prosperity. Thankfully, we got that.

测量手段之一即是 GDP（国内生产总值）。自 1980 年以来，在许多方面，增加 GDP 一直是许多中一右派政党们的党派存在的理由。**当时**，许多发达经济行业处于经济**病态**，通货膨帐率与夫业率持续居高不下。我们需要采取措施来扭转这种**停滞的局面**，走向通往繁荣之路。幸运的是，我们找到了解决问题的方法。

Today we need to be **just as revolutionary** to put us back on track tosocial prosperity：to respond to that **yearning** for happiness. That is why I have been arguing in Britain that we need to refocus our energies on **GWB — general well-being**. It means **recognizing** the social, cultural and moral factors that give true meaning to our lives. In particular, it means focusing on a **sustainable environment** and building stronger societies. And yes, it also means recognizing that there is more to life than money：indeed, that quality of life means more than the quantity of money.

今天，为了重新回到社会繁荣富强的轨道上我们需要**如同当时一样彻底改变思想**，即积极地响应对幸福**的追求**。这也是我在英国一直强调需要将精力集中干 GWB（General well-bing）即**国民健康总值**的原因。这意味着**认可**社会、文化、道德等斌予我们生活真实意义的因素。尤其意味着我们将集中于**坏境的可持续发展**，建立更强大的社会体系.这也意味着认可我们生活中有比金钱更重要的：确实，生活的质童绝不仅仅取决于金钱的数量。

I think the center-right can be the champions of this cause. The center-left never really get the well-being agenda because they treat individuals as units of account. And they find it difficult to understand how it cannot be **delivered** simply by the **push of a legislator's pen**.

我认为中一右派政党能够成为胜任此项事业的先驱.而中一左派政党将永远不会把人们的身心健康列入党派纲领议程，因为他们将个人看作记账单位。他们难以理解的是，为何通过**立法**也不能**实现**个人的身心健康。

Instead, the politics of well-being is a politics that needs to be founded on sharing responsibility. Of course, government must take its own responsibilities. But that needs to be part of a wider cultural change：a cultural change that will occur **as a consequence of** legislation, leadership and social change.

以人们身心健康为中心的政治需要各方人士各尽其责方能实现，而昨仅仅通过立法。当然，政府也需承担应尽的职责。这需要更广泛的文化变革：在立法、领导方式以及社会等各方面变革**之后**，才能引起这场大变革

What's the government's role? It is to show leadership and set the framework. Showing leadership means leading the **change** in the many areas that **impact on well-being**. For example, everyone would agree that spending more time with family is crucial to happiness. Here governments should be pioneers of flexible working with **public-sector employees**.

那么，政府的职责是什么？政府应尽领导职责，并制定规章制度，应尽领导职责是指在能**影响人们身心健康**的各个领域**变革**。比如说，人人都一直认为与家人共度更多时间是人们幸福的关键。那么在这方面，政府应当率先实行**公务员**灵活机动的工作时间

Setting the right framework means creating **incentives** and removing barriers to **remodel the context** within which the whole of society makes choices. Take the environment for example. Everyone would agree that a cleaner local environment would enhance our well-being. By setting a framework that creates a price for carbon in our economy and encourages green innovation, the government can help people make the better choice.

制定恰当的规章制度是值创设**激励机制**并排除障碍来**重建整个社会体系**，这样，社会的各个层面都能依此做出恰当的选择。以环境为例，人人都认为当地更洁净的环境会有助于改善人们的身心健康。通过订立为碳付出代价并鼓励环保创新改革这样的规章制度，政府就能帮助人们做出更好的选择

Ultimately, society's happiness requires us all to play our part. Indeed, playing our part is part of being happy. That is why we need a **revolution** in responsibility. **Corporate** responsibility means businesses taking a **provocative role**, and taking account of their employees' lives. **Civic responsibility** means giving power back to local government, **community organizations** and **social enterprises** so they can **formulate local solutions** to local problems. And personal responsibility means we all do our bit in cleaning up our local environment or participating in local politics.

归根结底，全社会的幸福需要每个人都尽一份力。实际上，每个人在尽力的同时也会感到快乐。这就是我们需要在责任观念上**变革**的原因。**公司**的职责是指企业公司发挥**积极的作用**，真正考虑到员工的生活。城市职责是指将权力返还给当地政府、**社区机构**以及**社会团体**一边他们能**因地制宜解决**当地的问题，个人职责是指每个人各尽其能，无论是清洁当地环境，还是参与当地政治

Neil Browne, professor of economics at Bowling Green State University, recently wrote an article:“If Markets Are So Wonderful, Why Can't I Find Friends at the Store?”It is not that markets are bad or that we are all **doomed** to a life of **perpetual** **unhappiness**. **Rather**, given our advances in terms of political freedom, economic enterprise and cultural **ingenuity** , life could, and should, be more satisfying. That is why focusing on general well-being could be the big , defining political concept of the 21st century. And by recognizing the responsibility every section of society has, we also have the means to enhance it.

Bowling Green 州立大学经济学教授耐尔·布朗最近写了篇文章，题为：“倘若市场上物品如此丰富，为何不见有“朋友”出售？”这并非市场物资缺乏或我们**注定永生不会快乐**。**相反，既然**我们政治上已经更加自由，经济更加繁荣发展，文化更加百花齐放，那么我们的生活能够并且应当更令人满意。因此，21世纪，致力于 GWB 的建设能成为一项重要的日益凸现的政治观念。我们在意识到社会的方方面面的责任的同时，也有办法来增强这些责任。

### B：找寻内心真实的呼唤

The very worst use of time in life is to stay for months or years at a job for which you are completely unsuited. However, a great number of people spend their whole lives doing something during the week so that they can somehow find something enjoyable to do on the weekend.

人们一生中利用时间最糟糕的莫过于经年累月地从事自己完全不合适的工作。可是，有 相当多的人却一生都是如此度过的：工作日内做做事，周末找些乐子。

In every case, these are men and women with very little future before them. They look upon their jobs as a form of **drudgery**, a **penance** they have to pay in order to enjoy the rest of their lives. And because of this attitude, they will seldom advance or be promoted. They will stay pretty much at the same level, moving from job to job, and always wondering why other people seem to live the "good life”while they feel they are living lives of **quiet desperation**.

从各种情况看，这些人的前途黯淡。他们认为自己的工作是**沉重的任务**，是他们为了享受余生对自己的**惩罚**。正是由于这种态度，他们很少会有发展或得到提升。他们总在原地踏 步，工作换了一个又一个，并老是弄不明白为什么别人能过上“好日子”而他们却生活在**无声的绝望**中。

People who are not successful and happy in their work are those who have not taken the time to sit down and **deal honestly and openly with themselves**. They have not looked deep within themselves to recognize the inner treasures of talent and ability that they have demonstrated throughout their lives. They are **content** to do work that other people design and to achieve goals that other people set.

那些在工作中不成功、不快乐的人，往往没有踏踏实实坐下来**坦诚地认识了解自我**。他们没有深深地审视自己，没有认识到他们生命中展现出的宝贵的才华与能力。他们**满足**于从事别人指派的工作，完成别人设定的目标。

**Over time,** people who are not following their true calling begin to feel helpless. They feel that there is nothing they can do to change things. Their income rises enough only to meet their **expenditures** and they worry about money much of the time. The future looks to them to be very much the same as the past. But this is not for you!

**日子一天天过去**，由于没有追随内心真实的呼唤，人们开始感到无助。他们感到自己无能为力，无法改变一切。他们薪水增长缓慢仅够维持**开销**，大部分时间都在担心钱不够用。前途对于他们和过去相差无几。可这悲哀的境遇应当不属于你。

Your aim in life is to become everything you are capable of becoming, to **enjoy full self-expression** of your talents and abilities.Your job is to develop yourself to the point at which every day is a source of joy and satisfaction, and you have so many interesting things to do that you do not have enough time to do them. Your mission is to continually hold up a mirror to yourself and refuse to work at anything that is not an expression of everything that is good and capable within you.

你生活中的目标应是将能力发挥到极致，**充分展现自我**才华与能力。你的工作就是不断完善自己，直至每天都成为你快乐与满足的源泉，而你会被许多有趣的事情环绕以至无暇一 一顾及。你的任务就是手握明镜照着自己，若任何工作不合适或不能彰显你的能力，就应当拒绝。

Success comes from being excellent at what you do. The market pays excellent rewards only for excellent performance. It pays average rewards for average performance and below average rewards —and **insecurity** —— for below-average performance.

成功来自于出色的工作表现。对于极佳的表现市场会赠与绝佳的报酬，中等的表现只能 获得中等报酬，而低劣的工作只会相应地获得低劣的报酬甚至有**丢掉工作**的风险。

But excellence is a journey, not a destination. You never really get there. You can never relax. The market is always changing, and what **constitutes** excellence today will be different tomorrow and very different next year and the year after.

然而，工作出色是一段旅程而非目的地。你永远也不可能真正到达。因而你永不可以停 歇放松。市场在不断变化，今日能**表现**出色，明日也许并不一定，明年乃至后年就更不一定了 。

All really successful and happy people know in their hearts that they are very good at what they do. If you are doing what you really enjoy or love , if you are following your true calling, you will know because of your attitude toward excellence.

所有真正成功且快乐的人们从内心深处得知自己擅长从事的工作。如果你从事真正喜欢 和热爱的事业，如果你追随了你内心真实的呼唤，你会知道自己是否擅长，就因你对出色的 态度。

When you find your true calling, you will have a continuous desire to learn more about it. A person who is not **driven** to learn more about his field is a person who is in the wrong job. And if a person is in the wrong job and not constantly learning and growing in his or her field, that person's value and his or her **employ-ability** is **diminishing** with each passing day .

一旦你找寻到了内心真实的呼唤，你会持续不断地去进一步了解它。若一个人没有**动力**去更多地了解自己从事的领域，那么他就选错了职业。如果他入错了行又不继续学习来增加自己对本行业的了解，那么他的价值以及被**聘用的可能性**将与日**递减**。

When you find your true calling, you will be determined to join the top 10 percent of people in your field. You will be willing to pay any price that is necessary to rise to the top. You will be willing to start work earlier than anyone else, work harder than anyone else, and work later than anyone else.

一旦你找寻到了内心真实的呼唤，你会决心成为本领域中顶级的10%里的人物。你会愿意付出任何必要的代价来跻身于顶级人物之列。你会愿意工作得比任何人都早，比任何人都勤奋，比任何人都工作时间长。

A simple test as to whether or not you are in your true calling is this：If you are doing the job that is meant for you, that uses your unique talents, you will automatically **admire** those who are at the top of your field. You will look up to them and want to be like them. They will be your role models, and you will **pattern** your work and activities after them . You will want to meet them, speak with them, read their books, and listen to their talks. The very best people in your chosen field will become the examples that give you guidance, **both spoken and unspoken**, on your upward journey.

一个简单的测试可以让你了解自己是否真正从事内心向往的工作：若你所从事的工作正是你应该从事的，能运用你独特的才能，你就会不自觉地**崇拜**那些本领域的顶级人物。你会向他们看齐，期望有朝一日能成为他们中一员。他们将成为你行业的典范人物，在工作和其 他事务上你会**模仿**他们。你会希望与他们会面、交谈，阅读他们的著作，聆听他们的讲话。在你所选定的领域里这些优秀的人才将成为楷模，**通过言谈和行为**，在你奋发向上的旅途中充当你的向导。

Throughout the years, I have been continually asked by people what they can do to be more successful. In almost every case, these people are working in jobs that they don't like, for bosses they don't particularly respect, producing or selling products or services to customers they don't care about. And many of them think that if they just **hang in there long enough**, the **clouds will part** and everything will get better.

这些年来， 一直有人不断地问我，要如何做才能更成功。很多情况下，人们从事自己并不喜欢的工作，为自己并不特别尊敬的老板干活，对购买自己产品或服务的顾客并不在乎。很多人以为只要自己**待足够长时间**，总有一日将**云开雾散**，情况越来越好。

But the fact is that **you are where you are and who you are** because you have chosen to be there. Nobody can help you or change your situation for you. The economic goal of your company is to hire people at the very lowest cost so that they can serve customers at the very lowest cost in a competitive market. For this reason, no one has any **obligation** to pay you any more than you are getting. If possible, he or she would like to pay you less.

但事实却是**你会原地踏步**，自己没有任何改观，因为你选择如此。没有人能帮你改变局势。你公司的经济目标是以最低廉的成本价格来招募职员，这样他们便能在竞争激烈的市场以最低的价格服务顾客。由于这样的原因，没有人有任何**义务**支付你更多的薪水。相反，如果可能，他倒愿意支付得更少些。

You must become great at doing what you are doing if you want to move up. And if you don't have the inner desire to be great at your job, it means you are probably in the wrong job.

如果你想努力向上，你必须在自己的岗位上做得最好。如果你没有促使你积极工作的内在动力，这意味着你很可能选错了职业。

A great **tragedy** is the number of people who do their **jobs in an average or mediocre fashion** and with the idea that when the right job comes along, they will really put their heads down and do a great job. But for some reason, the right job never comes along. They are always passed over for **promotions or advancement**.They are always the last ones hired and the first ones laid off.

**可悲**的是，为数可观的人们**工作平平**，却怀有这样一种想法： 一旦心仪的工作来临，他 们会全身心扑进去，干出一番成绩。但由于某些原因，合适的工作永远不会降临。**晋升与发展的机遇**总是与他们擦肩而过。他们总是受雇的最后人选，解聘的第一人选。

If you're still not sure about your true calling, ask the people closest to you, "What do you think I would do the best at in my life?" **It is amazing how** people around you, including your **spouse**, your best friends, and your parents, can clearly see what you should be doing when often you cannot see it yourself.

如果你仍不清楚自己的真实需求，问问你周围最亲近的人，“你认为我做什么最好?”**令人惊异的是**，往往当你自己还不清楚自己的真实想法时，你身边的人，包括你的**配偶**、最好的朋友、父母，却都能清楚地知道你应当做什么。

Remember, you were put on this earth to do something wonderful with your life. You have within you talents and abilities so **vast** that you could never use them all if you lived to be a thousand years old. You have **natural** skills and alents that can enable you to overcome any **obstacles** and achieve any goal you could ever set for yourself. There are no limits on what you can be, have, or do if you have your true calling, and then throw your whole heart into doing what you were made to do in an excellent fashion.

应该记住的是，你降临这个世上，是要有所作为的，你蕴藏着**极丰富**的才华与能力，即使是活到1000岁也无法穷尽。你**与生俱来**的技能与才华能让你克服任何**困难**，最终企及自己设定的目标。如果你找寻到了你内心真实的呼唤，那么你就可以成为你想做的人，拥有你想拥有的，做你想做的事，以绝佳的心态，全身心地投入到你的事业中去。

## Unit 6

### A：推进全球化

Here's a fact **worth reiterating:** despite the severe shocks and imbalances that have hit it off and on during the early years of this century, the world economy continues to grow, with low **inflation**. Of course, performance varies across countries and continents, but there are two **generalizations** you can make:The already rich countries keep enjoying **expanding economies**, and in the rest of the world millions of people overcome poverty every year, thanks to economic growth. Is there a force underlying this **benign evolution** that **transcends** national borders? Yes. That force is **international economic integration** — or globalization, if you wish. The market economy's capacity to fulfill human needs is being enhanced to an **unprecedented** extent by **international trade and investment**.

尽管本世纪初时不时出现严重的冲击和失衡，但世界经济持续增长，没有严重的**通货膨胀**，这是个**值得重申**的事实。当然，各国各洲情况不尽相同，但是我们可以作出两点**概括**：已经富有的国家保持**经济全面发展**，而其他地方每年有成千上万的人摆脱贫困。这都得益于经济增长。是否有一种什么力量在推动着这种**超越**国界的**良性进化**?是的。这种力量就是**国际经济大融合**。或者，如果你愿意，可以称之为**全球化**。**国际贸易和投资**将市场经济满足人类 需求的能力提升到了一个**前所未有**的高度。

National economies have become increasingly **interdependent**, and on the whole this process has added scale, flexibility and **productivity** to the global economy. Facilitated by modern transportation and communications and the **elimination** of trade barriers, specialization—that crucial vehicle of the market economy -- has become more and more **sophisticated**, as shown by the **complexity and efficiency of contemporary supply chains** . In today's global economy, firms and countries no longer specialize in the production of goods alone but increasingly in the **finer tasks** that **make up** the manufacturing, commercial and financial processes, bringing about lower costs, better quality and more choices for consumers.

国家间经济上**相互依赖**的程度越来越高，而就总体而言，这一过程扩大了全球经济规模， 提高了其灵活性和**生产力**。由于现代交通和通讯工具提供了便利，贸易障碍得以**清除**，专门化这一市场经济的重要载体变得越来越**复杂**。这点从**当今供货链的复杂性和有效性**上可见一斑。在现今的全球经济下，公司和国家不再专营商品生产，而是越来越专注于**精细的任务**。这些任务**贯穿**制造、销售和财务各过程，并实现降低成本、提高质量和为消费者提供更多选择的目的。

Globalization is providing the world with not only greater economic opportunities but also a remarkable **resilience** to events that in the past would have **proven(已经历过的)** highly **disruptive.** If you consider recent regional wars, terrorism, the **skyrocketing** prices of oil and other **commodities**, and the **laxity** in the **fiscal** and **monetary** policies of some of the major economies, you may conclude that it's only through the globalization of the market economy that we've been able to sail through such stormy waters.

全球化提供给我们这个世界的不只是更多经济发展的契机，还大大增强了我们的**抵抗力**， 可以轻松应对在过去**颇具颠覆力量**的事件。如果你考虑一下最近的局部战争，恐怖主义，**飙升**的油价和其他**日用品**价格，以及某些经济大国的**财务**和**货币**政策的**疗软**，你会得出这样的结论：正是通过市场经济的全球化，我们才得以在如此狂风巨浪中平安驶过。

For example, the **slack** in global demand created by the **sluggishness** in the European and Japanese economies during past years was more than **compensated** for by the rapid and **vigorous** globalization of China and other emerging economies. The new players have made world trade more dynamic and **enlarged the pool of world savings |** available to finance the **substantial** current account **deficits** **incurred** by the U.S. in recent years. Although of questionable **sustainability and convenience** in the medium and long term, these deficits have **nevertheless(仍然)** helped to support overall demand and growth in the short term — without, as yet, shaking international financial stability. The sharp increase in commodity prices over the last three years has not led to unbearable inflationary pressure because of the increasing presence of labor-abundant countries in world markets and the rise in productivity brought about by the **intensification** of global competition.

例如，在过去几年里欧洲和日本经济发展**迟滞**所造成的全球需求市场的**疲软**，已经被中国和其他正在崛起的国家的快速而**充满活力**的全球化进程**抵消**。而且这些新的参与者给世界贸易注入了活力并**增大了国际储备**，从而可以支持美国在近几年**造成**的**巨大**经常**账目赤字**， 这些赤字在不影响全球金融市场稳定的前提下，在短期内有助于支撑全面的需求和增长，虽然从中长期来看，其**稳定性和便捷性**仍值得探讨。过去三年的日用品价格的快速上升并未造 成无法承受的通货膨胀压力是因为全球市场中劳动力资源丰富的国家不断出现和全球竞争**加剧**所带来的生产力的提高（这一段真的能把人看吐，再看其他句子都觉得清新脱俗）。

**Don't Forget History**

Globalization has, in short, been an incredible force for good in the world. But is this force inexhaustible? Unfortunately, no. Modern globalization has so far proved stronger than the forces and events **arrayed** against it, but there's no guarantee this will always be the case. Just as with any other economic or social phenomenon, globalization faces risks that could challenge its growth or, worse, cause its reversal. This has happened before,most **dramatically** in 1914, with the outbreak of World War I, **the beginning of the end of** an extraordinary expansion in international trade, investment and migration that had **taken place** during most of the 19th and early 20th centuries.

全球化，简言之，是种不可思议的力量，为全世界带来了好处。但是这种力量是否无穷无尽?不幸的是，并非如此。迄今为止，现代全球化的确战胜了和它对立的力量和事件。但是我们不能保证这种态势能永远继续。正如其他任何经济或社会现象一样，全球化也面临着各种风险。这些风险可能阻碍其进一步发展，更有甚者，可能造成大逆转。这曾经发生过，最**严重**的一次是1914年， 一战的爆发**标志着**在几乎整个19世纪和20世纪初**全面发展**的国际贸 易、投资和移民活动**终结**。

Historians and economists increasingly remind us that human **folly** could once again cause the unthinkable. The inability to prevent violent conflict, as well as faulty policies in the face of **economic adversity**, were at the root of the **incredible destruction** of life, capital, trade and prosperity suffered by the pre-baby-boom generations of the 20th century. The strategies to **tackle** a new wave of globalization reversal are no mystery; they were learned through hard experience.

历史学家和经济学家一再提醒我们要警惕人类蠢行再一次导致不可想象的后果。20世纪 “人口爆炸”前的一代人遭受了生活、资本、贸易和繁荣的**不可思议的大毁灭**，究其根本，是面对暴力冲突的软弱无能和面对**经济困难**的错误政笨。**应对**新一波全球化逆转的战略并不神秘；他们是通过艰苦的经历学到的。

The pursuit of progress and security at the global level starts by every country's keeping its house in order, especially those that have a responsibility to **lead by example**. Part of this includes a country's supporting, in a rational way, its own people as they adapt to the **rigors inherent in free and open markets**. Another essential component is rules-based international cooperation, particularly when it comes to **containing** or **dissipating geopolitical** threats to global stability.

要想得到发展和安全，每个国家必须从我做起，管理好本国事务。特别是那些负有领导责任的国家更要**以身作则**。这一方面包括一个国家要理性地支持它的人民调整自己以适应**自由开放的市场所固有的一些困难**。另一重要方面是以规则为基础的国际合作，特别是在**抑制**或**消解**影响全球稳定的**地理政治**威胁方面（恶心+1）。

Following World War II this concept of cooperation was **embodied** in various **institutions and covenants,** which, for the most part, worked well for many years. Lately, however, the value of international cooperation seems to have been forgotten. **More frequently than not** international laws, agreements and institutions are **bypassed,** and various attempts to update these **indispensable instruments** have failed roundly. The **vision and leadership** that created and **sustained** them over time is now missing. We were **harshly** reminded of this **vacuum** this summer, first with the latest **collapse** of the Doha Round and then with a new **military conflagration** in the Middle East. Fortunately, the latter has — at least for the time being —been **subdued, revealingly** ,by **old-fashioned diplomacy** and an institution much **vilified** in recent years：the United Nations.

二战后，合作的观念已经**体现**在各种**制度和契约**中。多年来，这些契约在大多数情况下起到了良好的作用。但是，最近，国际合作的价值似乎被遗忘了。**更多情况下**，国际法规、协议和制度被**忽视**，而各种试图更新这些**必要工具**的努力也都彻底失败了。长期以来创建并**维护**它们的**远见卓识和领袖能力**不见了。今年夏天多哈会谈的最近一次**失败**和后来的中东又一 轮的**军事灾难**又一次**无情**地提醒我们这种**真空状态**。幸运的是，后者已经—至少暂时—**被控制住了**。**颇具启示意义**的是，中东局势得以控制靠的仍是一种老套的**外交**手段和一个近年来**广遭诋毁**的机构——联合国（恶心+2，这篇文章是最恶心的一篇文章，没有之一）。

### B：文化大不同

Let's say you are an 18-year-old kid with a really big brain. You're trying to figure out which field of study you should devote your life to, so you can understand the forces that will be **shaping** history for decades to come. Go into the field that **barely exists**：**cultural geography**. Study why and how people **cluster**, why certain national **traits endure** over centuries, why certain cultures embrace technology and economic growth and others resist them.

假设你是个18岁的有想法的聪明孩子，你正在试图决定自己应该为哪个领域的研究而奉献一生，从而能够理解那些能在今后几十年**塑造**历史的力量。那就请你选择这个**几乎不存在**的领域吧：**文化地理学**，研究人们为什么**聚在一起**，又如何聚在一起；为什么有些民族特征可以**延续**几个世纪；为什么有些文化拥抱技术和经济发展而有些却抗拒。

This is the **line of inquiry** that is now **impolite to pursue**. The **gospel of multiculturalism** preaches that all groups and cultures are equally wonderful. There are a certain number of close-minded **thugs** ,especially on university campuses, who **accuse** anybody who asks intelligent questions about groups and **enduring traits** of being **racist or sexist**. The economists and scientists tend to assume that material factors drive history —resources and brain chemistry —because that's what they can measure and count.

这是一门现今**被认为很无礼**的**学问(直译即调查路线)**。**多元文化主义的圣经**宣扬所有群落和文化都同样精彩。有些思维狭隘的**恶棍**，特别在大学校园里，**指控**任何一个对文化群落及其**持久的特征**进行研究的人都是**种族主义者或性别歧视者**。经济学家和科学家倾向于认为物质因素驱动历史—一资源和脑化学——因为这些他们可以测量计算。

But none of this helps explain a crucial feature of our time：while global economies are **converging,** cultures are **diverging,** and the widening cultural differences are leading us into a period of conflict, inequality and **segmentation**. Not long ago, people said that globalization and the revolution in communications technology would bring us all together. But the opposite is true. People are taking advantage of freedom and technology to create new **groups and cultural zones**. Old national identities and behavior patterns are proving **surprisingly durable**. People are moving into self-segregating communities with people like themselves, and building invisible and sometimes visible barriers to keep strangers out.

但是这些都无助于解释我们时代的一个重要特征：虽然全球经济在**汇聚**，文化却在**分流**。 而文化差距的扩大将我们带入一个充满冲突、不平等和隔离的时期。不久前，人们说全球化和通讯技术的革命会使我们走到一起来，但事实刚好相反。人们正在利用自由和技术建造着新的**文化群落和文化地带**。而一些旧的民族身份和行为模式显示出了**令人吃惊的生命力**。人们搬进自我隔离的社区和自己的同类住在一起。并修建了无形的、有时甚至是有形的屏障以 便将陌生人挡在外面。

If you look just around the United States you find amazing cultural segmentation. We in America have been“globalized”(meaning economically **integrated**) for centuries, and yet far from converging into some **homogeneous** culture, we are actually diverging into lifestyle segments. The music, news, magazine and **television markets** have all segmented, so there are fewer **cultural unifiers** like Life magazine or Walter Cronkite.

你只需环视下美国，就会发现惊人的文化隔离。我们在美国已经“全球化”(指经济**融合**) 了几个世纪了，而我们非但没有汇聚成一种**大一统**的文化，反而分流成了众多不同生活方式 的隔离区。音乐、新闻、杂志和**电视市场**全都分隔开了，所以几乎没有像《生活》杂志或沃尔特·克朗凯那样可以**同化文化**的现象了。

Forty-million Americans move every year, and they generally move in with people like themselves, so as the **late** James Chapin used to say, every place becomes more like itself. **Crunchy** places like Boulder attract crunchy types and become crunchier. **Conservative** places like suburban Georgia attract conservatives and become more so. Not long ago, many people worked on farms or in factories, so they had similar lifestyles. But now the economy rewards **specialization**, so workplaces and lifestyles diverge. The **military and civilian** cultures diverge. In the political world, **Democrats and Republicans** seem to live on different planets.

每年有四千万美国人搬家，通常是搬到他们的同类那里去。正如**已故**詹姆斯·查宾常说的，每个地方都更像它自己。像博尔德那样的**自由**地方会吸引更多的自由派从而变得更自由， 像佐治亚州郊区这种**保守**的地方会吸引保守派从而更保守。以前，人们或在农场或在工厂做工，所以生活方式是相类似的。但现在，经济崇尚**专门化**，工作和生活方式也因此分流。**军事和平民**的文化分流。在政界，**民主党和共和党**像生活在不同的星球上一样。

Meanwhile, if you look around the world you see how often events are driven by groups that reject the globalized culture. **Islamic extremists** reject the modern cultures of Europe, and have created a **hyperaggressive** fantasy version of traditional Islamic purity. In a much different and less violent way, some American **Jews** have moved to Hebron and become **hyper-Zionists**. From Africa to Seattle **religiously orthodox** students reject what they see as the **amoral** mainstream culture, and carve out **defiant** **revival** **movements**. From Rome to Oregon, **antiglobalization** types create their own subcultures. The members of these and many other groups didn't inherit their identities. They took advantage of modernity, affluence and freedom to become practitioners of a do-it-yourself tribalism. They are part of a great **reshuflling** of identities, and the creation of new, often more rigid groupings. They have the **zeal** of converts.

同时，如果你环顾一下世界，你会发现很多事件的发生都是由拒绝文化全球化的群体推进的。**伊斯兰极端主义者**抗拒欧洲现代文化，所以建立了一种**极具攻击性**的文化，幻想以此保留传统伊斯兰世界的纯洁。美国**犹太人**的做法与此不同并相对温和，他们搬到希伯伦成为**极端犹太复国主义者**。从非洲到西雅图，**信仰东正教**的学生摒弃他们认为**没有道德**标准的主流文化并发动了颇具**挑衅性的复兴运动**。从罗马到俄勒冈，**反对全球化的人**建立了他们的亚 文化。但是这些以及其他文化群落的成员并没有继承他们的身份，而是利用现代社会的富足和自由“自己动手”创造了新的部落文化。他们参与了身份大洗牌，划定了通常更严苛的、新的部落界线。他们有着皈依者的热情（又来）。

Meanwhile, **transnational dreams** like European unification and Arab unity **falter,** and behavior patterns across nations diverge. For example, **fertility rates** between countries like the U.S. and Canada are diverging. Work habits between the U.S. and Europe are diverging. Global inequality widens as some nations with certain cultural traits **prosper** and others with other **traits** don't.

另外，像欧洲大一统，阿拉伯世界大一统之类的**跨国梦想 滞步不前**。国际间的行为模式 也产生分流。如美国和加拿大的**人口出生率**差距在拉大；美国与欧洲的工作方式差距也在拉 大。全球不平等现象越来越严重，因为有某种文化特质的一些国家**繁荣昌盛**了，而有另外一些**特质**的其他国家却没有发展。

People like Max Weber, Edward Banfield, Samuel Huntington, Lawrence Harrison and Thomas Sowell have given us an **inkling** of how to think about this stuff, but for the most part, this is open ground. If you are 18 and you've got that big brain, the whole field of cultural geography is waiting for you.

马克斯·韦伯、爱德华·班费尔德、塞缪尔·亨廷顿、劳伦斯·哈里森以及托马斯·索 威尔等人在这方面已经做了些**粗浅的研究**，但是这一领域总的来说仍是一片有待开垦的广阔 天地。如果你已满18岁并且有聪明的大脑，文化地理学的整个领域正在等候你。

## Unit 7

### A：名家热

Few species have as many natural enemies as the celebrity professor. Other academics **envy** their money and fame; journalists dislike their **cleverer-than-thou airs**; and everybody hates their **determination to have it all** — the security of **academic tenure** and the **glitz of media stardom**. So these are happy days for the rest of us. **Plagiarism**, lying, **waffle-mongering** ; hardly a week goes by without some **academic celebrity** or other **biting the dust**, his **reputation in tatters**.

没有几个物种会像名家那样树敌众多。学者**妒忌**他们的名利双收。记者反感他们的**盛气凌人**。人人痛恨他们的**志在必得**，从**学术地位**的把持到**媒体上的频频曝光**， 一个都不放过。所 以对于我们外人来说倒是有热闹可看了。**剽窃**，说谎，**招摇撞骗**，几乎每周都能看到这个或那个**专家名流 身败名裂**， **一败涂地**。

Stephen Ambrose was **arguably** America's favorite historian, a man who wrote bestsellers faster than most people read them. An **inspirer** of Hollywood **blockbusters**, he can also **claim credit** for two of the best presidential biographies around, on Eisenhower and Nixon. But it now turns out that five of his books contain extensive "borrowings" from other historians. (“I'm not writing a PhD”, he has offered as an explanation — an unsurprising claim, as he would not get one for somebody else's work.)

斯蒂芬·安布罗斯**可以说**是美国非常得宠的历史学家。他创作畅销小说速度飞快，让读者目不暇接。他不仅是好莱坞**大片**的**创作源泉**，更因写下艾森豪威尔和尼克松的最佳总统传记而**广受赞誉**。不料，现如今却曝出他的五部作品过度地“借鉴”了其它历史学家的专著。(对此他 解释说“我又不是在写博士论文”,那是自然喽，靠别人的作品是不可能获得博士学位的。)

Mr.Ambrose must be grateful that attention has shifted to another cutter and **paster,** Doris Kearns Goodwin. She was a fixture on American television, always ready with a **telling anecdote on**, say, Lyndon Johnson (whom she knew) or Abraham Lincoln (the subject of her next blockbuster). Her handling of the **plagiarism charges** against her has arguably been worse than the charges themselves. In the late 1980s she **quietly mollified** one of her chief victims, paying her some money. Now she explains her behavior by the fact that she relied on handwritten notes —something other historians have managed to do without such **dire** **consequences**. Amazingly, Ms.Goodwin remains on Harvard's **board of overseers,** despite the fact that she committed **sins** that might get an undergraduate **expelled**.

现在安布罗斯想必可以略松口气了，因为舆论已将焦点对准另一位剪贴高手多丽斯·卡恩斯·古德温。她是美国电视节目的常客，对于诸如林顿·约翰逊或者亚伯拉罕·林肯等人 的**奇闻轶事总能侃侃而谈**(前者与她熟识，而后者将是其下一部巨著的主角)。但她对**剽窃指控**的处理可能比指控本身更糟糕。上个世纪八十年代末，她**用钱打发**了一名被剽窃的作者**让其保持沉默**。如今在解释自己抄袭举动时，她申辩道当初不得不依赖手抄笔记，很多历史学家都亦如此，只是并未引起**轩然大波**而已。令人不解的是，本科生犯了同样的**错误**会**被逐出校园**，而古德温却仍是哈佛大学的**校董会成员**之一。

The hunt is now on for the next serial plagiarist. Meanwhile, other charges are also being **hurled** at celebrity professors. Take **compulsive lying**. Joseph Ellis, the author of a first-rate study of the **Founding Fathers**, told his students that he had **fought in Vietnam** when the closest **he came to combat** was sitting in a university library. Or take **hypocrisy**. Paul Krugman, a professor of economics at Princeton University, used his **column** in the New York Times to **savage** the Bush **administration** for its links to Enron , when the fearless professor had himself received $37,500 from the energy firm. Or take general **flatulence.** **A** **squabble** between Larry Summers, **Harvard's combative new president**, and Cornel West, **a professor of black studies**, alerted the world to the latter's recent work, which turns out to be a mixture of **post-structuralist mumbo jumbo**, **religious rhetoric** and rap music. More should be expected from one of only 17 people to hold the **exalted** title of "university professor" at Harvard.

来看看另类的剽窃者吧。对名家的其他指控也**轰然而至**。罪名一，**满口谎言**。约瑟夫 · 艾利斯，创作的有关美国**开国元勋**的著作堪称一流。他曾对学生声称**打过越战**，然而实际上 他“**浴血奋战**”的地方不过是学校的图书馆。罪名二，**道貌岸然**。保罗·克鲁格曼是普林斯 顿大学的经济学教授，在纽约时报的**专栏**中**猛烈抨击**布什**政府**与安然公司相互勾结，这位“无畏”的教授却同时笑纳了能源公司的贿赂$37,500。罪名三，**欺世盗名**。**咄咄逼人的哈佛校长**劳伦斯·萨默斯和**黑人问题研究专家**康奈尔·韦斯特之间**争论不休**，使得人们注意到后者的 最新研究成果不过是饶舌音乐、**宗教辞汇**以及**后现代结构主义晦涩言语**的大杂烩。作为十七位被冠以哈佛顶级教授中的一员，康奈尔·韦斯特带给我们的应该绝非如此。

Is this a case of a few bad apples? In **Public Intellectuals** (Harvard University Press) Richard Posner, a federal judge, argues that it is the **whole barrel**. Although the book looks at all sorts of thinkers (not just **whorish** academics), Mr.Posner suggests that celebrity professors owe their influence to a **fraud**. They build their reputations **tilling** some **minuscule academic field**, and then **pontificate** on “Charlie Rose" about everything under the sun.

这仅是几个害群之马而已吗? 联邦法官里查德·波斯纳在其《**公共知识分子**》(哈佛大学 出版社)中认为，这是**整个学术风气的败坏**。审视各类学者教授(不单是**无良**学者), 波斯纳表示学术权威的影响力源于对公众的**蒙蔽**。他们在某些**狭隘的专业领域**里**打拼**， 一旦功成名就， 便在“查利·罗斯访谈秀”等节目上**煮酒论英雄(自以为是的谈论所有事情)**。

All true. Yet the judge, himself a leading **intellectual** for hire, is a little too harsh. Each celebrity professor may be a **nauseous beast**. Yet there are **two big arguments in favor of** what they do. Most obviously, they help to circulate ideas. They give educated **laypeople** a chance to get their information from real **authorities** rather than **mere journalists**. They give universities a chance to pay back some of their **debt** to the societies that **nurture** them. The fact that America's bestseller lists **feature** works written by academic authorities amongst the **ghost-written memoirs** and **celebrity suck-up jobs** should be cause for **rejoicing**.

话虽如此，同是受雇的**知识精英**，波斯纳未免有些偏激。名家也许是**卑俗不堪**的，但是至少还有**两点**说明他们的所作所为还是**不无裨益**的。首先，他们显然促进了思想的传播，使得受过教育的**普通人**有机会从真正的**权威**那里获取信息，而不仅仅是靠**平庸记者**的捕风捉影。 他们也使大学得以**回报**社会对它们的**滋养**。由**枪手代劳的自传**和**极尽谄媚之辞的作品**遍地都是，而美国畅销书的排行榜更青睐名家们的专著。这一事实也足以让我们**欣慰**。

The second point is that they help to keep talented people in academia. Some noble souls will always be willing to put up with low salaries in exchange for a chance to pursue the truth：it is hard to imagine John Rawlsl **hustling for a bit of extra cash**. But others are **inevitably** attracted to money and bright lights'. A bit of **moonlighting** is a relatively easy way for universities to keep some of **their smarter faculty** **happy**

其次，他们有助于让学术界留住人才。伟大的人物甘愿忍受清贫来换取追求真理的机会。 想想约翰·罗尔素岂会为**五斗米而折腰**。当然凡人**难免**会为名利所动。 一点**外财**就会让**有才华的教师在大学驻足**。

What about the costs of this moonlighting? Don't academic superstars **short-change** their universities? Well,a bit. Yet the **ostentatiously ludicrous** Mr.West has undoubtedly helped to attract bright students to Harvard in the same way **that those rather more serious once did**. Surveys suggest that academics who engage in outside activities are actually more likely to do their share of teaching than those who don't. Besides, the link between popular success and lower academic standards is **not sharp**. Mr.Ambrose and Ms.Goodwin both started “borrowing" other people's work before they **hit the big time**?.

赚取外财的代价是什么? 这些学术明星不会**有负(对不住)**校方吗? 也许会。**跟其他一本正经的教授一样**，韦斯特虽然**善于做秀**，毫无疑问也使不少聪慧的学生慕名进入哈佛。有调查表明，同那些没有社会活动的教授相比，经常抛头露面的学者能更好地履行职责。除此之外，声名鹊起和学术低下**没有必然联系(不矛盾)**。在**红极一时**之前，安布罗斯和古德温都曾以借用他人作品起家。

**Fundamentally**, the **besetting sin** of American academia is not celebrity professors but hyper-specialization. Academics have a habit of crawling along the frontiers of knowledge with a **magnifying glass**, blind to the **wide vistas** opening up before them, and often reducing the **most engaging subjects** to **tedious debates** about methodology. By looking at the big picture, **populists** restore the excitement of **intellectual life**. Who has done more for literary studies in the United States： Harold Bloom' or the thousands of **post-structuralists** and their **insufferable conferences**? Who has done more to advance the understanding of American business：Peter Drucker, who has never been employed by an **Ivy League university**, or the entire list of contributors to the Journal of Supply Chain Management?

**从根本上说**，美国学术界的**症结**并不在于名家个人而是研究视野的浃隘化。学者们总是手持**放大镜**沿着研究前沿匍匐前行，而对前方的**广阔天地**熟视无睹，经常将**最有价值的课题**演变为方法论的**无味争吵**。**平民知识分子们**则能放宽视野，恢复**学术生命**的活力。谁对美国的文学更有贡献：是哈罗德·布鲁姆还是千万个**后结构主义者**们，**他们无聊的研讨**? 谁能更新美国的商业理念：是从未被任何**名校**聘用的管理学家彼得·德鲁克，还是《批量供应连锁店管理杂志》的无数投稿人?

And the market does work.The same media machine that turned Mr. Ambrose and Ms.Goodwin into superstars is now **trashing** their reputations. The **honest majority of celebrity professors** improve the world by spreading **the** **fruits** **of academic** **research.** The dishonest minority **pay for their sins** with the loss of their **cherished reputations**.

市场是只无形的手。媒体曾将安布罗斯和古德温推向事业顶峰，如今却正让他们**名声扫地**。**真正的名家**积极传播**学术研究成果**以推动社会的发展，而那些欺诈之徒只会丧失他们**最看重的名节**，**为自己的错误买单**。

### B：抄袭有什么错呢？

Everyone knows the feeling. In a timely flash, the perfect **quip** forms in the mind and rolls onto the **tongue**. You deliver it to the table, and wait for the **gasps or guffaws.** In the silence that follows a dry voice says instead, "Yes,I read that too."

人人都有这样的体验。突然想到一个绝妙的**笑话**，溜到**嘴边**，告诉在座的朋友，你以为他们会**笑得前仰后合**，**喘不过气来**，不料换来的却是沉默，有人还无趣地说，噢，这个我也看过。

Authors have to wait longer to find out that their words are not theirs alone. But“unconscious borrowing”, as critics call such silent **plunder** , is common among writers, even the best of them. Perhaps because **night-foraging** by the imagination is so vital to literature, good writers react **warily** when, as now, **charges of plagiarism fly.** Though naturally eager to protect their own published words, and not above a **malicious** smile or two when others get caught, most authors recognize that this is **boggy** ground. Between imitation and theft, between borrowing and plagiarism, lies a wide, **murky** borderland.

作家往往要等更长的时间才知晓自己的作品不再为自己专属。在很多批评家看来，下意识借用几乎等同于无声**抢劫**，但是这一现象在作家甚至是巨匠中亦是见惯不怪的。也许因为借助于想象力的“**夜间觅食**”对文学是至关重要的，面对**抄袭之风盛行**，优秀的作家也变得**谨小慎微**。尽管出于本能大多数作家迫切需要保护自己问世的作品，甚至对被捉拿归案的剽窃者施以**不怀好意**的冷笑，但是他们也承认这确实是一个让人犯糊涂的**沼泽**地。模仿还是抄 袭，借鉴还是剽窃，它们之间有着广阔而又**模糊**的界限。

Since proving plagiarism is hard, legal **redress** is normally an expensive dream. The most that **aggrieved** authors can **count on** is to **shame** the wrongdoer. But shame means attention, and attention brings sales. Recently, Ben Okri,a Nigerian-born novelist, claimed that Calixthe Beyala, a French one, lifted whole **chunks** of his 1991 Booker-winning novel, for her bestseller. Plagiarism means copying **deliberately** the exact words. His were English, hers French. Showing that a **plundered** book is not the only source is also a defense. On the **advice of lawyers**, he has dropped his case against her, and in effect the **affair** has died.

由于举证剽窃步履维艰，谋求法律上的**赔偿**当然就是场奢望。**受害**的作者最多**指望谴责** 剽窃者。但是谴责就会引起关注，关注则带来销量的攀升。最近一位尼日利亚作家声称， 一 位法国女作家在其畅销小说中**大段**摘抄了他的获布克文学奖的小说。剽窃意味着对他人作品进行**有意**的逐字逐句复制。然而一个是英语， 一个是法语。**被剽窃**的作品不是唯一来源，这 一举证本身就为对方提供了辩护。在**律师的建议下**，他只得撤诉，让这件**事情**不了了之。

The personal **vendetta** carries different risks, as Neal Bowers, a **wronged** poet and teacher at lowa State University, **recounts** in Words for the Taking: The Hunt for the Plagiarist. One day, Mr.Bowers got a fax from California of a page from a poetry magazine **containing**, under the name of David Jones, a slightly **altered** version of a poem he had written for his dead father. Worse,he learned that the **purloined** **verses** had been successfully placed in several other poetry magazines across the country. An **outraged** hunt began. Mr.Jones,he learned, had plagiarized other poets. Some editors sympathized; others did not bother even to respond. Mr.Bowers became, on his own admission, obsessed. He lost friends. But in the end he found the plagiarist, through a lawyer, only to be offered $100 in compensation, and a **whining** apology.

个人的**抗争**总是风险重重。爱荷华州立大学教师尼尔·鲍尔斯，一位**受害**的诗人，在 《追击剽窃者实录》中**讲述**了自己的经历。 一天，他收到来自加州的一份传真，是一期诗歌 杂志的**内页**，他为过世的父亲所作的一首诗被**略作改动**后刊登其上，而署名却是大卫·琼 斯。更为可怕的是，这一**剽窃诗篇**竟然成功地刊登在其他好几种诗歌期刊上，遍及全国各 地。 一场**激愤**的调查开始了。结果发现该作者也曾经抄袭过其他作家的作品。 一些编辑对其遭遇深表同情，而另一些却置若罔闻。据他自己讲，他苦恼不堪，并为此失去了朋友。然而最后他通过律师找到了这位剽窃者，然而得到的不过是剽窃者100美元的赔偿金和**叫屈满天**的一声道歉。

Copyright and self-defense are not the only protection for authors.Humble readers are among their best police.The border between theft and borrowing is also **vigilantl**y patrolled ty seholars. John Frow',a university professor in Australia, has charged Graham Swift with pillaging William Faulkner.According to Mr. Frow, Last Order, which won Mr.Swift last year's Booker prize, takes liberally from the theme and the fictional devices of AF I Lay Dying.Its topic—how people dispose of the dead—is the same. Faulkner's book has a one sentence chapter, a chapter with **itemized** points and different speaking voices in different chapters. So does Last Orders.That is not plagiarism,Mr.Frow argues,but "imitation".Mr. Swift's fault, he suggests, is not to have made an explicit nod to the grand old man from Oxford, Mississippi.

版权和自我防卫不是作家寻求保护的唯一盾牌。广大的读者也是他们的守护神。当然，判断抄袭还是借鉴，还要靠学者们来明察秋毫。澳大利亚教授约翰·福娄就曾指责格雷姆·斯威夫照搬威廉·福克纳的东西。据福娄称，去年斯威夫的布克奖获奖作品《最后的遗言》从 主题到创作手法都随意地照搬《我弥留之际》。甚至连内容都一样——人们如何处置死人。福 克纳的《我弥留之际》有的章节独句成篇，有的章节只含有逐条列出的要点，不少章节含有 多重叙事，这些风格在《最后的遗言》中如出一辙。但福娄本人认为，这仅是模仿，还不能 算是剽窃，斯威夫的错误在于：他没有向来自密西西比州牛津城的前辈表示应有的尊重。

But there speaks a professor. Novelists are not bound by rules of **doctoral quotation**. The charge by Richard Pipes that Orlando Figes pinched findings of his without due mention has provoked a quarrel between these two well-known histo- rians of Russia.But theirs is not a **row-over** literary plagiarism.The allusions of novelists and poets are different from academic citations.When T.S.Eliot*and Ezra Pound freighted their verse with learned liftings from across the planet,they called it“**collage”** .Eliot did at times give sources but was laughed at for **pretentiousness.** In his Cantos,Pound seldom bothered to mention whose **fusty** trunk he was happily ransacking.

但是又有教授发话：小说家不必拘泥**博士论文引用规范**的条条框框。理查德·皮普斯控 诉奥兰多·菲格斯剽窃他的发现却没有加以应有的说明。这使得两位著名的俄裔历史学家反目成仇。但是他们的问题不同于文学上的争议。小说诗歌的典故不同于学术引用。艾略特和 庞德都曾搜罗世界各地智者的语言建构自己的诗篇，他们称之为拼贴艺术。艾略特倒是有时会标注出处，但总被人嘲讽为自命不凡。庞德的《诗篇》则绝口不提他的粘贴出自哪位老朽。

Where,then,does honest **allusion**, which authors want readers to catch, stop and sly thievery begin?Samuel Fuller,an American film director,put it well when he said of admiring French new-wave film makers,“They steal from us and call it **homage.** ”Questions of imitation,unflagged quotation and borrowing,unconscious or not,lead straight to the middle of the bog.Between mortal **pedantry** and wet indulgence,is there safe ground ?

那么,服务于读者的诚实**征引**，到底在什么情形下，会质变为狡诈的窃取呢?当提到法国新浪潮电影的制作者时，美国电影导演塞缪尔·富勒一针见血，“他们偷了我们的东西还说是向我们表达敬意”。模仿、引用和借用，有意还是无意，这些问题径直把人引入泥潭。要么是严重的卖弄学问，要么是过度地自我放纵，人们还能找到一个安全的立锥之地吗?

Intention has a lot to do with it.Poets,especially,are prone to unwitting copying since verse has **mnemonic** properties that prose does not possess.Thom Gunn?,reading poems of his in London two years ago said:“My greatest fear is that I'll discover or,worse,that someone else will point out to me —that I've stolen another man's words,thinking them my own."

动机是一个不可忽视的因素。特别是诗人，他们往往在无意中模仿，因为诗歌的记忆性 是散文所没有的。两年前汤姆·冈恩在伦敦朗读自己的诗歌时说，“我最担心有人站出来说我 剽窃他人的文字，却以为它们是我的。

Plagiarists,like forgers,have guilty intent,but of interestingly different kinds. An infamous early 20th-century faker such as Hans van Meegeren wanted his paintings taken for Vermeer's⁸.A plagiarist,by contrast,tries to pass off another writer's words as his own. Forgers sin against authenticity,plagiarists against originality

剽窃者和造假者都属动机不纯，但有意思的是，二者又有所不同。上世纪早期， 一些声 名狼藉的造假者，如梅格伦，巴不得别人把他的作品当成是大师维米尔的。而剽窃者则希望 将别人的作品据为己有。造假有违真实，剽窃毁灭原创。

There are copying traditions in which originality and its cousin,diversity,are not only not celebrated but positively frowned on.Sacred literature,with its frozen, **canonical** texts,is an obvious example.But originality and variety have always been prized in western writing,burden that they are on authors.Copyright laws date from the spread of the printed book in the 16th century.But interest in author- ship is ancient.All writers hate Homer,because Homer said everything first.Martial, a Latin poet and lewd gag-writer,likened his words to slaves,and an author who had stolen them to a plagiarist,or abductor, Varro,a scholar and friend of Cicero°"s, stripped the number of plays by Plautus from 130 to less than two dozen.

在某些抄袭传统中，原创性及其近亲多样性不仅不被重视，反而以此为耻。经典文学语 篇的因定规范就是一个最好的例子。但是在西方写作中原创性和多样性是为人重视的，是对 作者的考验。版权法虽起源自16世纪纸板书籍的流行，但对原创者的尊重却古已有之。所有 的作家都痛恨荷马，因为他写尽天下文章。拉丁诗人、喜剧作家马提雅尔把自己的作品称为 奴隶，而剽窃他们的作家就是诱拐者。西塞罗的朋友、学者马罗对普蒂图斯的剧作进行甄别， 使其数量骤减，从一百三十部缩至二十来部。

Most readers want a personal voice,hopefully one that belongs to someone who has read,thought and imagined a lot.People are maybe more knowing nowadays about how certain“personal voices”come into being.Authors have editors; they have co-authors and ghost-writers,not to mention models and literary god- parents to borrow from.But the idea —or ideal —of poems and novels as unique, personal creations is still essential.

大多数的读者渴望个性化的心声，那种真正来自善于阅读、深入思考、并且富于想象之 人的声音。现在人们更为清楚某种个性化的心声是如何造就出来的。作者要与编者打交道，作 者有合著者和枪手，更不必说还有文坛巨匠可以去借鉴。但是对于真正的诗歌和小说来说，个 人的原创仍是最重要的。

It is not hard to imagine two extreme sorts of writing where literary communication has broken down.One is so private,so personal and so original as to be **hermetic** and unintelligible.The other is so repetitive,mechanical and clichéd as to be empty.Between them is a pool of shared references and allusions fed by writers, but also by readers.Plagiarists drain the pool;borrowers put back what they take —though not necessarily in the same place.

不难想象，正是文学的两个极端使得文学交流日渐衰落。 一端力求个性、原创，以致最 终封闭迂腐。而另一端竭力重复、机械、陈词滥调，以致空洞无物。介于两者间的，就是作 者和读者用参考和典故填筑的一个深潭。剽窃者正抽干深潭，借用者则将其归还——尽管未必 会物归原处。
