```
Part IV Writing (25 points; 30minutes) 题目出自课外

```
	The evidence that China's total fertility rate has plummeted to 1.6, significantly below the UN-recommended 2.1 level for population stability, manifests that demographic sustainability faces a severe challenge. 
	中国总和生育率骤降至1.6，远低于联合国建议维持人口稳定的2.1标准，这一事实表明我国人口可持续发展正面临严峻挑战。
	How can the government effectively encourage Chinese women to embrace motherhood? I firmly believe a multifaceted strategy is imperative.
	政府应如何有效激励中国女性生育意愿？我认为必须采取多管齐下的策略。
	
	Personally, I contend that several critical measures could reverse this trend. 
	就个人而言，我认为扭转这一趋势需要几项关键举措。
	To begin with, substantial investment in affordable, high-quality childcare infrastructure nationwide is paramount. Many career-oriented women hesitate to have children due to crippling childcare burdens and workplace discrimination. 
	首要任务是在全国范围大规模建设普惠型优质育儿基础设施——许多职业女性正是因沉重的育儿负担和职场歧视而不敢生育。
	What’s more, implementing generous, long-term parental subsidies and tax incentives can directly alleviate the overwhelming financial pressures associated with raising children—from prenatal healthcare to education costs. 
	更重要的是，实施长期丰厚的育儿补贴与税收优惠政策，能直接缓解从孕产医疗到教育成本的全方位经济压力。
	For instance, extending maternal and paternal leave significantly, coupled with direct monthly stipends per child, could tangibly reduce economic anxieties. 
	例如大幅延长父母双方带薪育儿假，同时按月发放育儿津贴，将切实减轻家庭经济焦虑。
	Ultimately, a profound cultural shift is needed; government-led campaigns celebrating family life and gender equality in parenting responsibilities can dismantle outdated social norms that disproportionately burden women.
	最终还需推动深刻的文化变革：通过政府主导的宣传倡导，弘扬家庭价值与育儿责任性别平等理念，破除将生育责任不均压在女性身上的陈旧观念。
	
	If we did not place great emphasis on this demographic crisis, the nation's economic dynamism, social welfare systems, and even long-term national security would face grave threats from an aging, shrinking populace.
	若不高度重视这场人口危机，随着人口结构持续老化萎缩，国家经济活力、社会保障体系乃至长期国家安全都将遭受严重威胁。
	
	As far as I am concerned, it is high time that we highlighted the significance of building a genuinely child-friendly society and cultivated the citizens’ awareness that sustaining a healthy population structure is essential to our collective future prosperity. 
	在我看来，当下亟需强调建设真正友好型生育社会的重要性，让公民意识到：维持健康的人口结构是实现民族繁荣的根基。
	Only by enforcing these measures into practice, can our society be harmonious, our economy be more resilient, and we embrace more promising prospects together.
	唯有将这些措施落到实处，我们的社会才能更和谐，经济才能更具韧性，才能共同迎来更光明的未来。
